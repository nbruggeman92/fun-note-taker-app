# fun-note-taker-app

## Description

- My motivation for this project was to create a note-taking app with intuitive interactivity that people can use to jot down thoughts that are then saved.
- I built this project to provide a note-taking app for people using new skills I have learned in class.
- I learned a lot of new things about JavaScript and also learned how to connect front end to back end.
